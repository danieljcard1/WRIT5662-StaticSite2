  <h3 style="text-indent: 0px;">DIGITAL NARRATIVE & REFLECTION</h3><br />
  <p2 style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 2.3em">In conceptualizing my journey and newfound experiences in digital literacy, I immediately thought of the social media trend "How it started, how it's going." The purpose of that challenge is to post an old picture side-by-side with a current one showing progress. I decided that designing a Twitter post was a great way to symbolize the changes I have made this year.</p2>

  <p2 style= "margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 2.3em">Ever since I was little, I <b>loved</b> to write. Whether it was creating elaborate stories, writing a daily journal, or even endlessly practicing my handwriting to create my own "Rorie script", there was something extremely satisfactory about transferring the chaos in my mind into an organized finished product. When it came to deciding what medium to use, I was never fussy. I loved experimenting, especially as my interests became more digitally-based. Growing up alongside technology, I notice now that my creative escapades and skills advanced as technology continued to progress.<br /><br />


  Graduating from mere paper and crayons (the 64 pack with the sharpener included, of course), I began doodling with MS Paint on our desktop PC that basically weighed as much as I did. Then I was introduced to the world of Microsoft Word Clip Art and WordArt which beautified many an essay or poster board project. The mechanics were simple enough, but the opportunities to find relevant cartoon images and crazy fonts were endless. There would be no stopping this creativity train!<br /><br />

  As I grew older, I was introduced to more video games and software that stimulated my love for writing and illustration. I have this vivid memory of Computer Class in elementary/middle school. The first half of the class you had to complete a number of typing tasks through, then the rest of the time was free. At that time, my favorite game to play was Storybook Weaver, and I used that software for everything - from narrating make-believe stories to creating instructions on how to make a grilled cheese sandwich.<br /><br />


  Looking back on things now, I think Storybook Weaver is where I began my love of creating booklets of stories or information. This simple video game showed me how much further my creative thoughts and ideas could go, especially when using the right tools. From there, I continually sought out more apps, software, or devices that could enhance my documentation and design efforts. Whether it was through school or just for my own interests, I always wanted to try out the "next big thing", even if that meant just simply dipping my toe in the water. I appreciate Amruta Ranade's (2018) advice to learn new technology one small piece at a time. There are so many facets to learn and gain more proficiency.<br /><br />

  Knowing myself, I have always been a stickler for keeping things organized, putting things in a logical order, and making the finished product look spiffy. I have found that when those features are lacking, that is when I rise to challenge of filling that void. On multiple occasions I have started jobs where there was no on-boarding material provided for new hires. So, like the nerd I am, I created training manuals and user guides for software or processes for future hires to use for my own amusement. Creating documentation that clearly outlined everything someone needed to know to get the job done was exciting and fulfilling.<br /><br /></p2>
